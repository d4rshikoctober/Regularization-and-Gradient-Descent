# Regularization-and-Gradient-Descent
The code is written in python2 using pandas and numpy. 
Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function.
Common examples of algorithms with coefficients that can be optimized using gradient descent are Linear Regression and Logistic Regression
